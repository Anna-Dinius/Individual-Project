## How I Worked With AI During Week 2

- Use AI to generate one small piece of the app at a time
  - e.g. a widget, a screen, a function
- Examine the AI's code
- Use AI to explain pieces of code I don't understand
- Place the AI's code into my project
- Test the code to make sure it worked
- Copy & paste errors into AI (if needed) to debug
- Use AI to ensure I understand why the errors occurred & why the fix worked
